---[The KEYS global variable](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/interact/programmability/lua-api#the-keys-global-variable)
---* Since version: 2.6.0
---* Available in scripts: yes
---* Available in functions: no
---
---**Important:**
---to ensure the correct execution of scripts, both in standalone and clustered deployments, all names of keys that a function accesses must be explicitly provided as input key arguments.
---The script **should only** access keys whose names are given as input arguments.
---Scripts **should never** access keys with programmatically-generated names or based on the contents of data structures stored in the database.
---
---The _KEYS_ global variable is available only for [ephemeral scripts](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/interact/programmability/eval-intro).
---It is pre-populated with all key name input arguments.
---@type string[]
KEYS = {}
